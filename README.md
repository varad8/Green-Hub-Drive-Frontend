| @angular_fire_compat_storage.js |  This code defines a function called `summarize` that takes an object as its argument and returns a brief summary of its properties. The function uses the `Object.keys()` method to get an array of all the keys in the object, and then uses a loop to iterate over each key and add it to the summary if it is not one of the following:* `name`* `age`* `gender`The function also checks if the `age` property is a number and if it is less than 18, and if so, adds a message to the summary indicating that the person is underage.Here's an example of how you could use this function:```const person = {  name: 'Alice',  age: 25,  gender: 'female'};console.log(summarize(person));// Output: Name: Alice, Age: 25, Gender: female``` |
| @angular_forms.js |  The code you provided is a TypeScript file that exports several classes and functions related to form validation in Angular. It appears to be part of the `@angular/forms` package, which provides support for creating and validating forms in Angular applications.The `AbstractControlDirective` class is an abstract base class that provides common functionality for directives that act as wrappers around `AbstractControl` instances. It defines several properties and methods that are used by other directives in the `@angular/forms` package.The `ControlContainer` class is another abstract base class that provides common functionality for directives that act as containers for `AbstractControl` instances. It defines several properties and methods that are used by other directives in the `@angular/forms` package.The `NgControl` class is a directive that acts as a wrapper around an `AbstractControl` instance. It provides several properties and methods that can be used to interact with the control, such as `value`, `valid`, and `status`.The `NgControlStatus` class is a directive that displays the status of a control. It takes a `NgControl` instance as input and displays the control's status using CSS classes.The `NgControlStatusGroup` class is similar to `NgControlStatus`, but it displays the status of a group of controls. It takes a `ControlContainer` instance as input and displays the group' |
| @angular_google-maps.js |  A Google Map Info Window is a small window that appears when you click on a marker or the map. It displays information about the location, such as its name and address.The `MapInfoWindow` class provides a convenient wrapper for the Google Maps JavaScript API v3 Info Window. It allows you to easily add an info window to a Google Map and listen to events fired by the info window.Here's an example of how to use the `MapInfoWindow` class:```typescriptimport { Component } from '@angular/core';import { GoogleMap, MapInfoWindow } from '@angular/google-maps';@Component({  selector: 'app-map',  template: `    <google-map [options]=mapOptions      <map-info-window>Hello World!</map-info-window>    </google-map>  `})export class AppComponent {  mapOptions = {    center: { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 },    zoom: 16  };}```In this example, we create a `GoogleMap` component with some options and add a `MapInfoWindow` component as a child. The `MapInfoWindow` component contains the text Hello World! which will be displayed in the |
| @angular_platform-browser.js |  The code imports and exports various Angular platform-browser modules and utilities, including the `BrowserModule`, `DomSanitizer`, `EventManager`, and `HydrationFeatureKind` classes, as well as several other functions and constants. |
| @angular_router.js |  The code you provided appears to be a TypeScript implementation of the `UrlSerializer` class from the `@angular/router` package. This class is used to serialize and deserialize URLs in the Angular router.The `UrlSerializer` class has several methods that are responsible for converting between URLs and `UrlTree` objects, which are used to represent the state of the router. These methods include:* `parse()`: Converts a URL string into a `UrlTree` object.* `serialize()`: Converts a `UrlTree` object into a URL string.The `UrlSerializer` class also includes several other methods that are used internally by the router, such as `parseRootSegment()`, `parseQueryParams()`, and `parseFragment()`. These methods are not typically called directly by developers using the router.Overall, the `UrlSerializer` class is an important part of the Angular router, as it allows the router to work with URLs in a way that is agnostic to the specific format of the URLs. This makes it easier to use different types of URLs (e.g., hash-based, path-based) and to customize the URLs used by the router. |
| @canvasjs_angular-charts.js |  The code is a JavaScript library for creating interactive charts and graphs. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for creating various types of charts, including line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and more. The library also includes features such as data binding, animation, and exporting to various formats. |
| chart__js.js |  The code imports various modules and exports them under different names, primarily for use in a JavaScript library called Chart.js. |
| chunk-3QLSYPGU.js |  The code you provided appears to be a portion of a TypeScript file that defines a set of functions for working with Angular's dependency injection system. It is not clear what the purpose of this code is or how it should be used, but I can provide some general information about Angular's dependency injection system and how it might be used in practice.Angular's dependency injection system is a way of automatically injecting dependencies into components and services. This means that instead of manually creating instances of dependencies and passing them to components and services, Angular will automatically create and manage these dependencies for you. This makes it easier to write and test code, as well as making it easier to use third-party libraries and frameworks that rely on dependency injection.To use Angular's dependency injection system, you need to define a set of providers for your application. A provider is an object that contains information about how to create and manage a particular dependency. You can define providers in a number of different ways, including by using the `@Injectable()` decorator, by using the `provide()` method, or by using the `NgModule` class. Once you have defined your providers, you can use them to create instances of dependencies in your components and services.Here is an example of how you might use Angular's dependency injection system to create a simple service:```import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; |
| chunk-5FRTZUVI.js |  This code is a JavaScript module that exports several functions and classes related to Firebase App Check. The primary function of this code is to provide an interface for using Firebase App Check in a web application.The module imports several other modules, including ./chunk-JMNURLWY.js and ./chunk-MGYLO7NG.js These modules are likely dependencies of the Firebase App Check library and may contain additional functionality related to Firebase.The module also defines several classes and functions related to Firebase App Check, including AppCheckService initializeAppCheck getToken getLimitedUseToken onTokenChanged and setTokenAutoRefreshEnabled These functions and classes are used to interact with Firebase App Check and retrieve tokens for use in your application. |
| chunk-JMNURLWY.js |  This code is the main entry point for the Firebase JavaScript SDK. It imports various modules and defines a few functions that are used throughout the SDK.The primary function of this code is to import the Firebase JavaScript SDK and define a few functions that are used to interact with it. These functions include `initializeApp`, which is used to initialize a Firebase app, and `getApp`, which is used to retrieve an existing Firebase app instance.Additionally, this code also defines a few other functions that are used to interact with the Firebase Realtime Database and Cloud Firestore. These functions include `database` and `firestore`, which are used to retrieve a reference to the Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore, respectively.Overall, this code is responsible for setting up the Firebase JavaScript SDK and providing a way to interact with it from within a web application. |
| chunk-JN3CWD3G.js |  The code defines a set of utility functions for working with objects and classes in JavaScript, including methods for spreading properties, restoring objects, and creating commonJS modules. |
| chunk-KE7MBTFD.js |  The code defines a class called `HttpClient` that implements the `HttpHandler` interface. It has a single method called `handle()` which takes an instance of `HttpRequest` as an argument and returns an observable of `HttpEvent`.The `handle()` method creates a new observable of `HttpEvent` by calling the `doRequest()` method, passing in the `HttpRequest` object and an abort signal. The `doRequest()` method is responsible for making the actual HTTP request and returning an observable of `HttpEvent`.The `doRequest()` method first creates an instance of `RequestInit` from the `HttpRequest` object. It then calls the `fetch()` method to make the HTTP request. The `fetch()` method returns a promise that resolves with an instance of `Response`.The `doRequest()` method then subscribes to the response observable and processes the response. If the response is successful (i.e., the status code is between 200 and 299), it returns an observable of `HttpResponse`. Otherwise, it returns an observable of `HttpErrorResponse`.The `HttpClient` class also defines several other methods, such as `delete()`, `get()`, `head()`, `jsonp()`, `options()`, `patch()`, `post()`, and `put()`, which are used to make HTTP requests with different HTTP methods. These methods all call the `handle()` method with a `HttpRequest` object that |
| chunk-LHRTKJE6.js |  The code defines a set of utility functions for working with generators and async iterators in JavaScript, including `__extends`, `__rest`, `__awaiter`, `__generator`, `__values`, `__read`, `__spreadArray`, `__await`, `__asyncGenerator`, and `__asyncValues`. These functions are used to simplify the process of working with asynchronous code and to provide additional functionality beyond what is provided by the built-in `Promise` class. |
| chunk-LQ7JEHJ2.js |  The code defines a class called `AsyncAction` that extends the `Action` class. It represents an action that is scheduled to be executed at some point in the future, and it has a `schedule` method that takes a state and a delay as arguments and schedules the action to be executed after the specified delay.The `schedule` method first checks if the action is closed, and if so, it returns an error. If the action is not closed, it sets the `pending` property to `true`, sets the `delay` property to the specified delay, and requests an asynchronous ID using the `requestAsyncId` method.The `requestAsyncId` method is not defined in the code snippet, but it is likely to be a method that requests an asynchronous ID from the scheduler. The method takes the scheduler and the current asynchronous ID as arguments and returns a new asynchronous ID.The `recycleAsyncId` method is also not defined in the code snippet, but it is likely to be a method that recycles an asynchronous ID that is no longer needed. The method takes the scheduler, the current asynchronous ID, and the delay as arguments and returns a new asynchronous ID if the delay is the same as the current delay and the action is not pending, or `undefined` otherwise.The `execute` method is called by the scheduler when the action is due to be executed. It sets |
| chunk-MGYLO7NG.js |  /**   * Gives you an instance of a Logger to capture messages according to   * Firebase's logging scheme.   *   * @param name The name that the logs will be associated with   */  constructor(name3) {    this.name = name3;    this._logLevel = defaultLogLevel;    this._logHandler = defaultLogHandler;    this._userLogHandler = null;    instances.push(this);  }  get logLevel() {    return this._logLevel;  }  set logLevel(val) {    if (!(val in LogLevel)) {      throw new TypeError(`Invalid value val} assigned to `logLevel``);    }    this._logLevel = val;  }  // Workaround for setter/getter having to be the same type.  setLogLevel(val) {    this._logLevel = typeof val === string ? levelStringToEnum[val] : val;  }  get logHandler() {    return this._logHandler;  }  set logHandler(val) {    if (typeof val !== function {      throw new TypeError(Value assigned to `logHandler` must be a function    }    this._logHandler = |
| chunk-NX3ADSVA.js |  The code defines a class called `Color` that represents a color in the RGB color model. It has several methods for manipulating the color, such as `mix`, `interpolate`, and `rotate`. It also has a number of static methods for working with colors, such as `rgbString`, `hexString`, and `hslString`.The class takes an input object or string as its constructor argument, and it uses various parsing functions to determine the color values. If the input is an array, it is assumed to be an array of RGBA values. If the input is an object, it is assumed to be an object with `r`, `g`, `b`, and optionally `a` properties. If the input is a string, it is parsed using a variety of regular expressions to determine the color values.The class also has a number of helper functions for working with colors, such as `clone`, `clearer`, `greyscale`, `opaquer`, `negate`, `lighten`, `darken`, `saturate`, `desaturate`, and `rotate`. These functions modify the color object in place, so they do not return a new color object.Overall, this code defines a class for working with colors in the RGB color model, and it provides a number of methods for manipulating and converting colors. |
| chunk-SPSDNB3W.js |  The provided code defines a module that exports several functions and variables related to Firebase Authentication. The main function of the module is `_performApiRequest`, which performs an API request to Firebase Authentication servers. The function takes several arguments, including `auth`, `method`, `path`, `request`, and `customErrorMap`. It returns a promise that resolves with the server response or rejects with an error.The module also defines several other functions and variables, including `_addTidIfNecessary`, `_performFetchWithErrorHandling`, `_performSignInRequest`, and `DEFAULT_API_TIMEOUT_MS`. These functions and variables are used by `_performApiRequest` to perform the actual API request and handle errors.The module also imports several other modules, including `querystring`, `Logger`, and `ErrorFactory`. These modules are used by the functions in the module to perform various tasks, such as constructing query strings and logging errors. |

| index.esm-UB2DOZEO.js |  The code imports several modules from other files, likely for use in a larger program. |
| ng2-charts.js |  The code defines a function that creates a new function that wraps another function. The new function has the same arguments as the original function, but it also takes an additional argument called `thisArg`. The `thisArg` is used as the `this` context for the wrapped function when it is invoked.The function also takes an optional `bitmask` argument that can be used to specify additional behavior for the wrapped function. The `bitmask` can be used to specify whether the function should be curried, flipped, or have its arguments rearranged.The function returns a new function that can be invoked with the same arguments as the original function, but with the additional `thisArg` argument added at the beginning. The new function will then wrap the original function and use the `thisArg` as the `this` context when it is invoked.The function also supports partial application by taking an array of arguments to be prepended to the arguments passed to the wrapped function. The function will then return a new function that can be invoked with the remaining arguments.Overall, the function creates a new function that can be used to wrap other functions and provide additional functionality such as currying, flipping, and partial application. |
